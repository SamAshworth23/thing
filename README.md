# thing
this is a thing

I won't hold you down

Pick heads off forget-me-nots – the faded light of memories
The spirit of the summerhouse it still hasn’t left me
A haze over the house we shared, a flag of permanent defeat
I’m screaming at the august sun, I know you can hear me

Over and over in my head (Over and over)
I haven’t convinced myself yet (We’re not getting older)

Won’t force you down, never will, I guess I’ll just see you around
Heart beats me down, hollow now this house is a burial ground
I guess I’ll just see you around
So lay the weight of your world on me
